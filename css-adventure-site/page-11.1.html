            You chose to be a sad clown! 

            While a hard decision to make, you knew it was the right one for you! 
            Sad clowns actually arent always sad. They are more creative with their 
            expression and often find pathways as models, artists and singers!

            Youre excited to see what this new school year brings you 
            END
