            You chose to be a happy clown! 

            While a hard decision to make, you knew it was the right one for you!
            Happy clowns are bold and confident in their clownsonas. They aim to 
            make others happy and find themselves as acrobats, trapeze artists and traveling in circuses! 

            Youre excited to see what this new school year brings you 

            END
